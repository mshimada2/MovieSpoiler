    <h2>Plot</h2>

    <p>
       WWII is raging on. The British are losing drastically due to the Germans
      unbreakable machine the Enigma, which codes the Nazis orders to the German Navy.
      In order to break the code, the British Government hires a team of mathematicians
      and cryptographics. <span class="spoil-protect">Among the team is the founding father of computer science,
      Alan Turing. Turing believes that the only way to decrypt Enigma is to build
      a machine to decrypt the code.
      Turing then builds a machine which he calls Christopher.
      Christopher is able to encrypt the code once Turing realizes there are already
      repeated words that are said in the code such as Heil Hitler.
      Due to this realization, the code is broken and millions of lives are saved due to it. </span>
